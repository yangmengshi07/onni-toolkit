# Onni Haptic Toolkit (Preview)

Onni is a tangible interface designed to support affective haptic communication across distance.  
This repository shares early research prototypes of the hardware, firmware, and interaction logic developed for Onni.

## Repository status

This is a preview release created alongside our TEI 2026 submission.  
It currently includes:
- Preliminary hardware references (V5 internal layout and expansion board draft)
- Arduino firmware for motor actuation and vibrotactile feedback
- Authoring interface for custom gesture-to-haptic mappings

The full replication package will be uploaded in a later update.

## Intended use

The aim of this toolkit is to enable researchers, designers, and interaction practitioners to:
1. Reproduce a working Onni-like prototype
2. Modify sensing and actuation mappings
3. Explore how custom haptic “gestures” can be co-created and refined in real-world contexts
